Just looking around. You will find a support page with someone saying:

> Hi. I tried adding my favorite Irish person, Conan O'Brien. But I keep getting something called a SQL Error

You might guess this SQL error is cause by the `'` in his name.

thus we can try a simple SQL payload in username: `admin' --`, and we get the flag.
