# Intro

This page will contain my first ever write-ups (woohoo)!

It will have short notes on each level of pwn.college's Program Misues module exercises, babysuid.
The module is about privilege escalation. Each level will let me use one program with unnecessary SUID, and I will have to *abuse* that program to read **/flag** using the root privileges. 

Let's get started then!
